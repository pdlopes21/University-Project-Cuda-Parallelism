# University-Project-Cuda-Parallelism
This project is a copy of the one delivered on the last assignment in Parallel and Concurrent Computing.

It has no further alteration or explanation, if there is any doubt please contact me via email.

It's main purpose is to implement and compare an expression evaluating algorithm run on the CPU to one run on GPU using CUDA, running on a remote GPU using Colab.
